				<P>

				<P>
				To book the accommodation, see "More Info" on the <A href="http://store.leeds.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/environment/geography/geocomp-2017-geocomputation">booking site</A>. This is 
				in our "<A href="https://www.meetinleeds.co.uk/venue/storm-jameson-court/">Storm Jameson</A>" block, is reasonably priced (see booking site for conference discount code) but also pretty plush for student accommodation, and is five minutes walk from the conference. We strongly recommend booking here, but if you want recommendations for other nearby hotels, see 
				<A href="accommodation.html">our accommodation page</A>. Please note that we can only hold our rooms at Storm Jameson until the 19th June, after which availability may be limited.
