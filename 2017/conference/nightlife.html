				<P>
				We doubt, knowing GeoComp, you'll want to do anything 
				other than head to bed early every night with a cocoa, 
				but given the <i>very</i> slim chance you 
				might want to head into Leeds for an evening, we 
				thought you might like some recommendations. Our excellent PhD students 
				have pulled together this helpful list.

				<P>
				(NB:In terms of safety, Leeds is a generally safe city, 
				but like any other major 
				town, you obviously need to keep your wits about you.)

</P>
<P>
<A href="http://www.revoluciondecuba.com/bar/leeds/">Revolucion de Cuba</A> (end of Call Lane) has a salsa class social on Tuesdays, or general salsa music all night.

More relaxed for a quiet night: 
</H1>

<P>There are a number of pubs around  the University, including the 
<A href="http://www.thefaversham.com/">Faversham</A> just down the hill from Storm Jameson; 
<A href="http://thefentonleeds.com/">The Fenton</A> ~500m down towards town from the 
Parkinson Building; can have live bands; and <A href="http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/lifestyle/bars/pub-review-the-pack-horse-woodhouse-lane-leeds-1-3188740">The Packhorse</A>, 
<A href="http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/lifestyle/bars/pub-review-the-eldon-leeds-1-7026126">Eldon</A>, and 
<A href="https://www.social-squirrel.com/thelibraryleeds">Library</A>, all of which are ~500m up the road the other 
way. The Library usually has plenty of space for bigger groups.
</P>
<P>
In town, the <A href="http://turksheadleeds.co.uk/">Turk's Head pub</A> is worth a visit, as 
is the <A href="http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/lifestyle/bars/pub-review-the-victoria-great-george-street-leeds-1-6406489">Victoria</A> &ndash; elegant town pub from a bygone era. You might also 
be interested in the old traditional pubs down the alleyways on the left 
as you go down <A href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Briggate,+Leeds/@53.7968027,-1.5439362,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48795c196fe5bd47:0x8b6ee7140f000b87!8m2!3d53.7968027!4d-1.5423886">Briggate</A>, such as 
<A href="http://www.whitelocksleeds.com/">Whitelocks</A>. They're not large enough for big groups, but they are otherwise worth the visit. If you're feeling 
geographical, you might like to know that the alleys exist because they 
mark out roads between the old Anglo-Saxon field units.
</P>
<P>
<A href="http://www.friendsofham.co.uk/">Friends of Ham</A> is a charcuterie bar, serving lots of good wine and beer. 
</P>
<p>In terms of specific drinks, 
<a href="http://www.thedecanter.co.uk/">Decanter</A> specialises in wine, while 
for sherry and Tapas, we recommend 
<A href="http://www.ambiente-tapas.co.uk/">Ambiente</A>; Cocktails: 
<A href="http://thealchemist.uk.com/venues/trinity-leeds/">Alchemist
</A> and <A href="http://thebotanist.uk.com/locations/trinity-leeds">Botanist</A> in the Trinty Centre, and beers: <A href="http://tappedleeds.co.uk/">Tapped</A>.

Cafés / No alcohol lounges:
</H1>
<P>
Rendezvous Café and Lounge is a nice zero-alcohol lounge that's 
open late. You can find it <A href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Rendez+Vu/@53.8104664,-1.5598559,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48795eab90ae5fa3:0x53d6ff614ef29ed!8m2!3d53.8104664!4d-1.5576672?dcr=0">next to the University</A>. 
</P>
<P>
There are also plenty of cafés open in town, though they tend to shut around 6 or 7 unless they are also serving alcohol. Later than that, your best bet is 
<A href="http://labottegamilanese.co.uk/">La Bottega Milanese</A> (which does 
serve wine and beer as well), and the other resturants in 
<A href="http://thelightleeds.co.uk/">The Light</A>, as well as those in 
<A href="https://trinityleeds.com/">Trinity</A>.

It would be impossible to list all the great resturants in Leeds, but 
good areas to look for places to eat include 
<A href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Millennium+Square,+Leeds+LS2+3AD/@53.8011435,-1.5500713,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48795c1ce3155d21:0x201a8c6aaaff7620!8m2!3d53.8011435!4d-1.5478826">Millennium  Square</A>, <A href="http://thelightleeds.co.uk/">The Light</A>, <A href="https://trinityleeds.com/">Trinity</A>, and <A href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Call+Ln,+Leeds+LS1/@53.7957722,-1.5431056,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48795c19a381007f:0x3a61652aa0e6f419!8m2!3d53.7957722!4d-1.5409169">Call Lane and the Calls</A>.
