				Leeds (<A href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Leeds/@53.7570236,-2.3523824,271095m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x48793e4ada64bd99:0x51adbafd0213dca9!8m2!3d53.8007554!4d-1.5490774">map</A>) has a wide variety of entertainments and sightseeing opportunities within the city, but is also central in the UK, with good connections to a wide range of day trips and areas for longer breaks, especially around the rest of Yorkshire, the county it sits within. This page gives some suggestions for 
				things to do in Leeds, Yorkshire, and the UK, including some <A  href=#kids>days out if you're bringing kids</A>.

				<h2 class="animated fadeInDown">Things to do in Leeds</h2>

<P>
Leeds has some nice attractions worth seeing. If you're walking, then the 
<A href="http://www.leeds.gov.uk/museumsandgalleries/Pages/Leeds-City-Museum.aspx">City Museum</A> and <A href="http://www.leeds.gov.uk/museumsandgalleries/Pages/Leeds-Art-Gallery.aspx">Art Gallery</A> are pretty good for 
free provincial cultural institutions (the <A href="https://www.henry-moore.org/hmi">Henry Moore</A> next door to the gallery specialises in scupture). Also good is the 
<A href="https://www.royalarmouries.org/home">Royal Armouries</A> and general Leeds <A href="http://www.visitleeds.co.uk/things-to-do/shopping.aspx">shopping</A>, the most interesting of the latter being in the various covered 
<A href="http://leeds-list.com/out-and-about/leeds-shopping-arcades-from-past-to-present/">historical arcades</A>. Worth an explore is the area around 
<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granary_Wharf">the Dark Arches</A> (under the station) and <A href="http://www.leeds.gov.uk/leedsmarkets/Pages/default.aspx">Kirkgate Market</A>. One of the nicest things about Leeds is that it wasn't extensively bombed during World War II, so it has some great 
<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Leeds">architecture</A> &ndash; as you're wandering around, keep looking up!
</P>
<IMG src="county.jpg" alt="County Arcade" width="100%"></IMG>
<P>
 If you have transport, or can afford a taxi or a bit of a walk, <A href="http://www.thackraymedicalmuseum.co.uk/">the Thackray Medical Museum</A> is great, and further out there's <A href="http://harewood.org/">Harewood House</A> and 
<A href="http://www.leeds.gov.uk/museumsandgalleries/Pages/Temple-Newsam.aspx">Temple Newsam</A>. If you're after a night out, there are obviously lots of clubs, pubs and resturants, but there's also four theatres, two cinemas, and 
a host of other things going on; details on 
<A href="http://leeds-list.com/culture/">the Leeds List</A>.
</P>

<h2 class="animated fadeInDown">Things to do around Leeds</h2>



<H2>York</H2>
<P>
While Leeds is all about the dreams of Victorian Industrialists, York is all about the Medieval. It's about 20 mins on the train from Leeds, and a good day out. Worth a visit are the <A href="http://www.yorkshiremuseum.org.uk/">Yorkshire Museum</A> and <A href="https://www.yorkminster.org/home.html">Minster</A>. Also good fun is <A href="http://jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/">Jorvik Viking Centre</A>. There's some nice shops in the <A href="http://www.insideyork.co.uk/what-to-see/shambles.html">Shambles</A>, and train 
enthusiasts will love the <A href="http://www.nrm.org.uk/">National Railway Museum</A>. The art gallery is good, but a particular highlight is the 
<A href="https://www.centreofceramicart.org.uk/">Centre of Ceramic Art</A>.
</A>
</P>
<IMG src="shambles.jpg" alt="The Shambles, York" width="100%"></IMG>

<H2>Manchester</H2>
<P>
Probably Leed's main rival in the North, Manchester is the city's brash, exciting, cousin. Well set up for entertainment, Manchester has <A href="http://www.visitmanchester.com/">plenty to see and 
do</A>, and is only about 50 minutes on the train from Leeds. Great for a night out (and there are late night trains back), it is 
known for its LGBT centre  
<A href="http://www.canal-st.co.uk/">Canal Street</A>, along with the (sadly 
now demolished) <A href="http://www.fac51thehacienda.com/">Ha&ccedil;ienda</A>, which led the way in British music for 20 years. For programmers, it has has a special place as one of the centres of 
<A href="http://www.turing.org.uk/scrapbook/manmach.html">early computing</A> and 
the home of <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</A> after the war; if you want to see some of the early computing elements, sign up for the conference 
<A href="register.html">fieldtrip</A>. 
</P>

<H2>Liverpool</H2>
<P>
Famously home to the "<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_music">Mersey Sound</A>" in the 60s, and especially The Beatles, Liverpool also has a wider cultural and historical presence within the UK and is an easy day trip from Leeds by train. Of special note 
are the <A href="http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/">International Slavery Museum</A>; the <A href="http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/index.aspx">Maritime Museum</A>, with its Titanic collection; the <A href="http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-liverpool">Tate Liverpool</A> art gallery; and, of course 
the <A href="https://www.cavernclub.org/">Cavern Club</A>, but Liverpool has a wide variety of really excellent <A href="http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/">museums and galleries</A>, along with 
a wide range of <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool#Landmarks">cultural and historical</A> sites. 
</P>
<A name="dales"></A>
<H2>The Yorkshire Dales</H2>
<P>
If you want to get out of town and into the <A href="http://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/">Yorkshire Dales</A>, you can get the 
train to Ilkley or Skipton. 

Ilkley is a small town in Wharfedale, from which you can walk up onto the <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Ilkla_Moor_Baht_'at">famous</A> (in Britain anyway!) Moor. There's some lovely 
<A href="http://www.ilkleymoor.org/walks/">walks</A>, both short and long, many of which take in 
<A href="http://www.stone-circles.org.uk/stone/rombaldsmoor.htm">bronze age rock art and stone circles</A>. Back in town, there are plenty of places to eat, though the most famous are 
<A href="http://www.bettys.co.uk/tea-rooms/locations/ilkley">Betty's</A> and, for foodies, <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Box_Tree">The Box Tree</A>. 
</P>
<IMG src="ilkley.jpg" alt="Ilkley Moor" width="100%"></IMG>
<P>
Skipton is a classic Dales market down in Airedale. Worth a visit is the well preserved 
<A href="http://www.skiptoncastle.co.uk/">Castle</A>, but it's a nice town to 
just wander around. Skipton is the "Gateway to the Dales": from here you can get by car or bus (<A href="https://www.dalesbus.org/">Dales Bus</A>) to such delights as 
<A href="http://www.malhamdale.com/cove.htm">Malham Cove</A> or 
<A href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/upper-wharfedale">Upper Wharfedale</A>. Alternatively, a great way to see the Dales is to take the classic British railway 
journey from <A href="http://www.settle-carlisle.co.uk/">Settle to Carlise</A>, which you can start from Leeds.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, you could head by train to 
Hebden Bridge in Calderdale, which is a <A href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/04/hebden-bridge-cultural-centre-yorkshire">great community of thinkers and artists</A>. Most notable for its <A href="http://www.hebdenbridge.co.uk/tourist-info/tourism-guide.html">shops and caf&eacute;s</A>, there's also 
an interesting <A href="http://alternativetechnology.org.uk/visits/index.html">the Alternative Technology Centre</A> on the canal. While it's a fair walk to Dales-like countryside, there's nice walks to 
<A href="http://heptonstall.org/">Heptonstall</A> (where American poet Sylvia Plath is <A href="https://heptonstall.org/sylvia-plath-burial-site/">buried</A>) and 
<A href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hardcastle-crags/">Hardcastle Crags</A>. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the area is Haworth, home of the Bront&euml;s, though it is  
<A href="http://www.haworth-village.org.uk/visitors/visitors.asp">a little hard to get to</A> (watch the return buses on a Sunday) &ndash; if you're a fan of the Bront&euml;s, the 
village and <A href="https://www.bronte.org.uk/haworth-and-the-brontes/haworth">Parsonage</A> are definitely worth a visit, and there's plenty of interesting shops and places to eat there as well.
</P>

<h2 class="animated fadeInDown">Things to do around the UK and Europe</h2>
				
<H2>London</H2>
<P>
Leeds is within two hours train journey of <A href="http://www.visitlondon.com/">London</A>, though it's a stretch to fit anything in for a day-trip and you're better planning a longer break there if you'd 
like to see it. If you are heading that direction, then <A href="https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/">Bletchley Park</A> is worth the detour, along with the associated 
<A href="http://www.tnmoc.org/">National Museum of Computing</A> (note opening days for the latter on the website): you can get there by train from London, or via Birmingham from Leeds. In London 
itself is the <A href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/">Science Museum</A>, which includes a wide ranging collection around <A href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/exhibitions/computing">early computing</A>, 
including a working implementation of Babbage's <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">Difference Engine No. 2</A>; but also good are the 
<A href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/">Natural History Museum</A>; 
<A href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">The British Museum</A>; 
<A href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/">The National Gallery</A>; and the 
<A href="http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern">The Tate Modern</A> along with any number of 
<A href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/articles/Londons-most-unusual-museums-50-of-the-best-part-one/">quirkier places</A>.
</P>
<H2>Scotland</H2>
<P>
Edinburgh is a (beautiful) three hour train ride from Leeds, and makes a great starting point for <A href="https://www.visitscotland.com/">visiting Scotland</A>, as well as having a great deal 
to offer <A href="http://edinburgh.org/">as a city itself</A>. On the way up, there's also <A href="http://hadrianswallcountry.co.uk/">Hadrian's Wall</A>, the final frontier of civilisation, as far as 
the Roman Empire was concerned. There's a variety of <A href="http://hadrianswallcountry.co.uk/travel/bus">bus options from Newcastle and Carlisle</A> along the wall.
</P>
<IMG src="hadrians.jpg" alt="Hadrian's Wall" width="100%"></IMG>
<H2>The National Parks</H2>
<P>
Leeds is very convienient for visiting some of Britain's best national parks. As well as the <A href="#dales">Dales</A>, there's also 
<A href="http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/">The Lake District</A>; 
<A href="http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/">The Peak District/Derbyshire</A>; 
and 
<A href="http://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/">Northumberland</A>


<H2>Southern England</H2>
<P>
If you feel like going further afield, and are happy hiring a car, you could do a lot worse than head to Southern England, and a very nice few days can be spent exploring 
the little cluster of sites between the ancient cities of  <A href="https://visitbath.co.uk/">Bath</A>; 
<A href="http://www.visitwiltshire.co.uk/salisbury">Salisbury</A>; and 
<A href="http://www.visitwinchester.co.uk/">Winchester</A>; including 
<A href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/">Stonehenge</A> and 
<A href="https://www.glastonbury.co.uk/pages/">Glastonbury</A>, 
<A href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/white-horse-hill">Uffington</A> and 
Cerne Abbas (we'll leave you to search that one!).
</P>
<IMG src="stonehenge.jpg" alt="Stonehenge" width="100%"></IMG>
<H2>Europe</H2>
<P>
Finally, if you want to head to the continent for a break, there are good connections from Leeds to Europe, via London and the 
<A href="https://www.eurotunnel.com/uk/home/">Eurotunnel</A>. Paris is ~four hours train ride from London, and from there you can travel to anywhere from Norway to Turkey, and beyond. Airports nearby include 
<A href="http://www.leedsbradfordairport.co.uk/">Leeds/Bradford</A> (linked by bus to Leeds) and <A href="http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/">Manchester</A> (linked to Leeds by train).

				<h1 class="animated fadeInDown">Intro to Yorkshire:</h1>

				A lot of sites in the UK are managed by either
