				<h1 class="animated fadeInDown">Entertainments:</h1>
				<P>
				While we hope you find the presentations interesting and inspiring, we've also got a 
				variety of diversions lined up for you during this celebratory conference.  
				</P>
				<hr>
				<P>
				<H1>In the conference pack:</H1>
				<hr>
				<P>
				<STRONG>Celebratory journal issue:</STRONG> With thanks to our sponsor <A href="http://journals.sagepub.com/">Sage Publishing</A>, we include a special issue of 
				<A href="http://journals.sagepub.com/home/epb">Environment and Planning B</A> celebrating 21 years of GeoComputation. 
				This includes an editorial by our keynote speaker Mike Batty and a reflective portmanteau by a sample of GeoComputational academics, familiar and new. 
				</P>
				<hr>
				<P>
				<STRONG>Presentation prize:</STRONG> The <A href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/">Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)</A> have kindly sponsored a 
				prize this year for the best PhD presentation. There's a form in your pack; please do vote for your favourite, and place the form in the 
				box by reception before the final keynotes on Thursday.
                </P>         
				<hr>
				<P>
				<STRONG>MicroBit + competition:</STRONG> With thanks to the generous sponsorship of the <A href="http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/">Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA)</A> we're 
				delighted to include a <A href="http://microbit.org/">BBC MicroBit</A> in the pack, to celebrate 21 years of GeoComputation. The MicroBit is 
				an initiative to teach computer programming to young people across the UK. All the instructions you need are in the box, but 
				essentially if you plug the MicroBit into a laptop or other computer, and go to the <A href="http://microbit.org/code/">coding page</A>, you 
				can generate either Scratch-like Javascript or MicroPython programs that you save/drag onto the MicroBit to work. 
				</P>
				<P>Please do share your programs (there's a 'share' button when you write a program, which will generate a URL); mail them to <A href="mailto:contact-us@geocomputation.org">contact-us@geocomputation.org</A> 
				or tweet them with #GeoComp2017 or to our 
				<A href="https://twitter.com/GeoCompNews">Twitter feed</A>: there'll be prizes for the best! 
				</P>
				<P>
				After the conference, please do pass the MicroBit on to a young person if you don't want to keep it yourself, or we'll have a box by reception for 
				unwanted MicroBits which we'll donate to a local youth group.
				</P>
				<hr>
				<P>
				<STRONG>Book orders/R Workshop:</STRONG> In your pack, you'll also find a discount form for publications from 
				<A href="https://www.crcpress.com/">CRC Press</A> including the recent "Spatial Microsimulation for R", and for Sage's <A href="https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/geocomputation/book241023">GeoComputation: A Practical Primer</A> book. We're holding a mini-workshop on 
				GeoComputation with R entitled "Spatial Data and the Tidyverse" on Monday evening between the conference and the evening event, 
				and there's still a few places left if you'd like to <A href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/spatial-data-and-the-tidyverse-tickets-37278529084">register</A>. We'll 
				be having a launch for the "Spatial Microsimulation for R" book during the evening event on Monday.

				<A href="https://quantile.info/giscrg/">GIS</A> and  
				<A href="https://quantile.info/2014/09/30/quantitative-methods-research-group/">Quantitative Methods Research Group</A> we'll 
					be having an evening event in the University's <A href="locations.html">Great Hall</A> on Monday night (6pm for food at 6.45). We'll also

				<STRONG>Tuesday, Explore!</STRONG> Tuesday night is your own, to explore Leeds, a lively and entertaining city. We've drafted up a brief 
				<A href="nightlife.html">guide to the nightlife of Leeds</a> to help.
				</P>
				<P>
				<STRONG>Wednesday, Dinner and Live Music Coding:</STRONG> The conference dinner this year is at the <A href="locations.html">Hilton DoubleTree Hotel</A> (7pm, or walking down from the 
				<A href="locations.html">Parkinson steps</A> at 6.30pm). Before the food, we're delighted to say that local 
					<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave">algorave</A> coder <A href="https://twitter.com/beaconbelisha">Belisha Beacon</A> will 
					be doing a live coding event. You can read more about her in this <A href="http://mixmag.net/feature/female-coders-algorave">MixMag article</A>.
				</P>
				<P>
				<STRONG>Thursday, Fieldtrip to Manchester:</STRONG> The conference ends at mid-day on the 7th, after which some of us will be heading  
				to the heart of the industrial revolution: Manchester! We'll be going to the 
				<A href="http://msimanchester.org.uk/">Museum of Science and Industry</A> where they have various items from the early history of computing, 
				including a working <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom">Jacquard Loom</a> 
				and a working renovation/replica of the <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Small-Scale_Experimental_Machine">Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine</A> 
				aka "Baby", the world's first stored-program computer. It's all quite informal, as we're now going by train, so if you'd like to join us, we'll be announcing 
				details on the last day of the conference.
