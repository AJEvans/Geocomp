<h2><b>Professor A. Stewart Fotheringham, National University (Maynooth), Ireland</b></h2>
<h4>Geographically Weighted Regression and Geocomputation: An Overview of Recent Developments</h4>
<div class="fotheringham"></div>
<p><b>Abstract: </b>Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a well-known technique to investigate 
spatial nonstationarity in relationships.  It is part of a growing trend away from global ‘one-size-fits-all’ 
models and towards local models where relationships may vary over space. It is a quintessential geographical 
model because it uses locational information and produces geocoded outputs than can be mapped. The concept 
of GWR will be explained and some examples given of how it can be used to identify spatial variations in relationships.  
The talk will then describe some recent advances in GWR research including:
<ul><li>The development of semi-parametric GWR models</li>
<li>The development of new software for GWR, GWR 4.0</li>
<li>Inference in GWR</li>
<li>The transference of the concept of geographically weighting to other types of geographical models such as spatial 
interaction models</li></ul>

<p><b>Biography: </b>Professor Fotheringham is Director of the National Centre for Geocomputation at the National 
University of Ireland, Maynooth. He holds PhD and MA degrees from McMaster University in Canada and a BSc from 
Aberdeen University in Scotland.  His research interests include:  quantitative spatial analysis; spatial statistics; 
Geographic Information Science; spatial interaction modelling; spatial choice modelling; and spatial cognition. 
He has published 9 books; 28 chapters in books and over 100 refereed journal articles.  Professor Fotheringham has 
been involved in large geographic Information initiatives in the USA, Canada, the UK and Ireland.  He has received 
over 20 million euros in grants and is currently Director of a Staretgic Research Cluster in Advanced Geotechnologies.  
He has delivered over 100 presentations at academic conferences (many of them invited keynote addresses) and has given
60 invited seminars at universities around the world.  He is one of the developers of Geographically Weighted Regression 
and has conducted 17 invited workshops on GWR.</p>
