<h4>The Future of Geocomputation</h4>
<div class="clarke"></div>
<p><b>Abstract: </b>Geocomputation is the "Art and Science of Solving Complex Spatial Problems with Computers. " The field 
sits across the ever narrowing divide between geographic information science and computer science, and includes modeling, 
spatial analysis and visualization. Computing has changed immensely over the last decades, and current developments such as 
Web 2.0, social networking, mobile computing and the cyberinfrastructure have changed the entire face of computing. What 
lies in the future for GeoComputation? In this presentation I will review computational history over the last 50 years and 
how it relates directly to Geography, and then provide some pointers to what geospatial computing might involve 50 years 
into the future. Future trends are examined in six areas: data fusion, mobile systems, ubiquitous computing, web-enabled 
computing, interactive multimedia, and biocomputing.</p>
<p><b>Biography: </b>Keith was Chair of the UC Santa Barbara Geography Department 2001 to 2006. He was elected President of 
CaGIS in 2001, was selected as UCGIS Educator of the Year in 2002, and is a recipient of the 2005 John Wesley Powell Award, 
the USGS's highest award for achievement. In 2006, he became a Fellow of the ACSM, the Chair of the NAS Mapping Sciences Committee, 
and was appointed to the National Geographic Committee on Research and Exploration; in 2007, Keith received a UK Leverhulme 
Trust award and Fulbright Distinguished Scholarship. For Kieth Clarke's biographical sketch <a href = "clarke-bio.pdf">click here.</a></p>
