<h1>Invited Speakers</h1>

<h2><b>Dr. Jo Wood, City University, United Kingdom</b></h2>
<h4>Does Visualization with Geocomputation offer anything we didnâ€™t know already?</h4>
<div class="wood"></div>
<p><b>Abstract: </b>Many people who find themselves conducting geocomputation will have a background in,
or at least have been exposed to, the visual representation of spatial data. Whether though traditional
cartography, standard outputs from GI Systems or through statistical graphics we are used to seeing pictures
of our data and analysis. Yet the growing disciplines of Information Visualization and Visual Analytics as
well as the catch-all GeoVisualization suggest there has been substantial academic development in the science of visual representation as part of
the analytic process. Can we learn from these disciplines or are they merely retreading issues that cartographers and
GI scientists have understood for decades? <br /><br />
This talk will consider some of the history and recent developments in
Information Visualization and Visual Analytics to reflect on what lessons might be learned for Geocomputation. An overview
of some of the visualization technologies not traditionally associated with GI Systems and Geocomputation will be given
along with some of the techniques that might offer benefit for those analyzing geospatial data.

<p><b>Biography: </b>Dr
Jo Wood is a Reader in Geographic Information Science at the giCentre, City University London. He has been researching and
teaching in the fields of GIS and visualization for 20 years and has over 80 peer-reviewed papers, book chapters and published
 conference proceedings in this field. He is a member of a number of international programme committees in the fields of 
 visualization and GI science including IEEE Information Visualization, IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology, UKVAC 
 Workshop on Visual Analytics, EuroVis, Spatial Accuracy and Geomorphometry. He is author of a number of software applications 
 for GI analysis and data visualization including LandSerf, giCentreUtils and treeMappa.</p>
